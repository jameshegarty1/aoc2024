Each line is an equation.

Test value on LHS of :. Need to check whether numbers on RHS combined with operators can produce the test value

Operators always work left-to-right.

Numbers in the equation cannot be re-arranged.

Add (+) and multiply (*) are the only operators.


Need to sum up the test values which can be produced by inserting operators.



Plan:

(1) Define "equation" struct which has test value and list of numbers.

(2) Iterate over data, create a vector of structs.

(3) Identify number of spaces where operator could be inserted. = n-1
