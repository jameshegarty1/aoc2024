Need to wordsearch for "XMAS"

It can appear in any direction.

Plan:
Parse bytes into grid. Loop over grid, whenever X is found, search for "M", if found, identify the direction of XMAS for that instance, then check if A and S can be found in the same direction. 


Need to also consider boundary conditions.
