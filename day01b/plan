Need to find frequency of left numbers occurring in the right list. The number of times it appears * the value of itself is the "similarity"
Need to sum up the total similarity


Problem is that for each element in A, we need to iterate over entirety of B. Instead, maybe we can create a hash map when we first parse the input.
