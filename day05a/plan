Input has 2 parts

(1) - Page ordering rules

X|Y means that if both X and Y are to be prints, X must be done before Y

(2) Pages to produce in each update

P1,P2,P3,P4...

Need to check each update against the rules, if any rule is violated, then the update is void.

The solution is the sum of the middle pages of the valid page updates.


Plan:

(1)
Read the rules into a map where:

key = page number
value = list of pages which it must precede if both are present.

(2)
Loop over the updates.

Within each update we have a comma separated list of pages.
Each page we encounter, we need to check our rules. 
If that page must occur before any other page WHICH HAS ALREADY come up within the update, then the update is void.

If the update has not been voided, grab the middle page and add it to the solution.
