Two more instructions to handle:

do() enables future mul()
don't() disables future mul()

Program starts as enabled.

Previous method of windows(4) wont really work as it was designed to work specifically with mul(.

Option (A)
We can do the same as before, and add all the instructions + their starting points (index where mul begins) to a data structure.

Now we need to iterate again and identify the indices where do() and don't() instructions occur (index where the instruction ends)

Now we should filter out the mul instructions which are in disabled areas of the memory.


Option (B) 
Re-design the algorithm to keep a boolean is_enabled updated as we iterate over the data. When we encounter a mul() instruction, we need only check if is_enabled. While iterating, we need to be able to identify any of the instructions.


I will instead simply iterate over all the bytes. Will use the vec.starts_with() to identifyinstructions.
