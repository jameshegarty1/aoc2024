For part 2 we actually have to find "MAS" in the shape of an X:

```
M.S
.A.
M.S

```


It should be pretty easy. We look for "A", then we check the 4 directions:

(
-1,-1, (M)
-1,1, (M)
1,-1, (S)
1,1 (S)
)


Actually I was mistaken and there are 4 possible orientations which are allowed.

...
S.S
.A.
M.M
...

...
S.M
.A.
S.M
...

...
M.M
.A.
S.S
