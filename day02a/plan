One "report" per line of the input.

Each report is a list of numbers called "levels" which are space separated.

A report counts as "safe" if and only if:

* The levels are either *all increasing* or *all decreasing*.
* Any two adjacent levels differ by *at least one* and *at most three*.


Answer: number of safe reports from the input.


Plan:
Iterate over data set line by line.
Assume report is SAFE initially.

Iterate over report. If next element is equal or abs_diff > 3 then set UNSAFE and exit report. After first check is done, we set increasing/decreasing flag. If next element violated that, then exit. Continue until done.
